3.  **INT. Library Lobby and Reference/Circulation Desk**
    Sitting behind the combination reference and circulation desk, the librarian sits 
    waiting expectantly as the two patrons look around with puzzled faces

                                  JERMS A. ALLY
                     (Turns toward Eliza James) I need to go shelving our returns; do you 
                     need anything before I go?


                                  ELIZA JAMES
                     No, thank-you. I can handle our new patrons. (Jerms A. Ally turns away
                     and gradually fades away as he walks towards a dim silhouette of book-shelves
                     in the distance)

                     (Eliza turns towards the patrons) Now, how can we help you today? Do you want
                     to know about the services offered by the library? Or are you interested in 
                     some of our unique collections?

                                  LIBRARY PATRON #1
                     What just happened? Where is the parking lot? (they whip their head from side-
                     -to-side, becoming visibly agitated)

                                  ELIZA JAMES
                     (chuckling while a smile starting from the corner of her lips) You can turn
                     around and leave through the front door. Don't worry, the parking lot is where
                     you left it. The library is here to help you find information, even if you're
                     here just for fun! (Looking at patron 2) Are you okay?

                                  LIBRARY PATRON #2
                     (The stern look on their face slowly disolving as they take in the entire 
                     reference desk and the library shelves going leading off into the distance)
                     I'm, I'm, just trying to understand...what kind of questions do you answer?

                                  ELIZA JAMES
                     We're a special public library so we try to answer all questions, even if 
                     have to defer answering your question until we can research the right answer
                     for you.

                                  LIBRARY PATRON #2
                     Ok, well, what are your hours? Do you have any novels? 

                                  ELIZA JAMES
                     Well, we are open from 9 until 9 local galatic time. We have a number of novels
                     both historical, current, and even the best sellers! If you are looking for a 
                     particular book and we don't have it; we'll use our inter-library-loan service
                     and get it to you as quickly as we can.
