1.  **EXT. Suitcase Library in a parking lot**
    A strange suitcase containing wooden shelves on the outside with a closed umbrella
    suddenly shakes and what looks like a small door opens and out steps a bald, middle-aged 
    white man, wearing short shelves, round-rim glasses, and an polo shirt with khaki pants who
    seems to grow larger as he steps out onto the pavement.

                                   JERMS A. ALLY
                     Hello (in a parched voice that he then clears)! Welcome to the 
                     Library. How can we help you?

                                   LIBRARY PATRON #1
                     (looking puzzled) How did you fit inside that small suitcase?

                                   JERMS A. ALLY
                     Aww (with a slight smile) that is the magic of the library. Do you
                     want to see our books or other materials? Or we can help answer any
                     of your questions. 
                     
                                   LIBRARY PATRON #1
                     Ok, (turns towards their companion) do you want to see?

                                   LIBRARY PATRON #2
                     This is very weird. (turning towards Jerms A. Ally) What sort of library 
                     is this? It looks like a suitcase but libraries are buildings!

                                    JERMS A. ALLY
                     A library isn't a specific location or building but is about people and 
                     information. We are a traveling library and when we 
                     visit a location, we temporary expand our library collections and services.

                                   LIBRARY PATRON #2
                     What! Why? Why do we need this? (turning towards their friend) Something 
                     isn't right.


                                   JERMS A. ALLY
                     Or left (he says while smiling again) Why don't the two of you come inside and
                     ask the reference librarian about the nature of our library. (He turns and opens
                     the very small door on the suitcase library and as he steps in, beckens to the
                     patrons to follow)

                                  
                                   LIBRARY PATRON #1
                     Lets see what this is all about (patron takes a step into the door and starts
                     to shrink, the second patron gasps and reaches out with their hand and stumbles
                     forward into the door)

  
2.  **INT. A small room with a desk surrounded by book shelves
    Behind the reference desk is a middle-aged black woman, with short black hair with streaks of 
    gray with a pair of glasses perched upon her nose. Jerms A. Ally is standing to her left and 
    looks back as the patron one steps through to the floor and patron two rights themself.

                     Welcome to the library! How can we help you?
