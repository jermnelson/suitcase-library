(openai.com generative text to prompts in bold below)

**Welcome to Suitcase Library 001 zero day campaign. Participants include Head Librarian Eliza James, Cataloger Ryu Dun, Library Clerk Jerms A. Ally, and System Admin and Web Designer Kumo.** We will be updating this page with additional information, including the schedule and how to get a copy of the book.

What:

The Suitcase Library is a traveling collection of books, zines, and comics that will be distributed to the communities **as we travel through-out the multiverse. We start in Colorado Springs from the home of our founder and initial donor Jeremy Nelson.**

**Eliza James suggests we begin the meeting using the Rules of Robert. Ryu Dun seconded the motion.** 

**All in favor, raise your appendages, (four raised)**

Voting done, Our first order of business is to talk about how we want to structure ourselves. The first order of business is to elect a Chair of the group. Jerms A. Ally nominated Ryu Dun to lead the meeting. Ryu Dun seconded the motion. 

All in favor, **raise your appendages. Kumo, Jerms A. Ally, Eliza James, and Ryu Dun all voted in the affirmative.** The motion is passed. Ryu Dun is the Chair of the meeting.

Our second order of business is to elect a secretary. Jerms A. Ally nominated Eliza James to record the meeting. Eliza James seconded the motion.

All in favor, raise your appendages. Ryu Dun, Jer**ms A. Ally voted in the affirmative, Kumo abstained.**

**Next order of business, Head Librarian report. Eliza James said, "We are still in construction phase of the library. While the initial book collection has been decided, we still need the book shelves, technology, and the first audio and video collections to be determined"**

Library Clerk report. Jerms A. Ally said, "I will be working on the cataloging and digital collection, as well as fundraising, and marketing. I will be working with library systems and other librarians to get materials for collection as well as looking into the digital library of the future."

**Ryu Dun raised an objection regarding the Library Clerk's report. "Should I be responsible for cataloging and shouldn't the Head Librarian be leading the fundraising and marketing efforts?"** 

Eliza James responded, "As our first order of business, we should review the structure of the group. I propose that Ryu Dun become the Chair and Jerms Ally become the Secretary. The two will work with me on the management of the Library while I am acting as the Head Librarian. I believe **our first priority should be on getting a viable and working library in place. Our first patrons and opening day is scheduled for later in the First Month.** 

I also think that this is the perfect opportunity for us to get our feet wet regarding the management of the library and to make a decision on how we want to structure ourselves. I do not believe that we should confine ourselves to just one model. We should be prepared for the situations **we may encounter."**

**Kumo asked a point-of-order, "Are we voting on the Jame's proposal for the structure of the group with Ryu Dun as chair and Jerms Ally as secretary?"**

Eliza James responded, "We are going to vote on the proposal presented by me. If you want to present an alternative structure, then it is up to you to bring that proposal to the table."

**Kumo, "I second the motion to the structure of our group with Ryu Dun as chair and Jerms Ally as secretary."**

**I responded, "All those in favor of the motion to structure the library staff meetings with Ryu Dun as chair and Jerms Ally say or text Aay"**

All raised appendages or typed Aay.

The meeting was adjourned by Ryu Dun.
